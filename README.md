# Next-MUI Template

This is a boilerplate template for creating a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project with [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), including:

- Standard MUI dependencies (including Icons)
- Cache and theme provider components in the root layout
- An example of an Emotion styled component being used in the root `page` server component

*Note: the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag may be required to install dependencies due to the use of the React 19 release candidate version*

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
